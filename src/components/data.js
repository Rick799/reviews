    review:
      "I found myself wishing Inception were weirder, further out. The film is Nolan's labyrinth all the way, and it's gratifying to experience a summer movie with large visual ambitions and with nothing more or less on its mind than (as Shakespeare said) a dream that hath no bottom.",

    review:
      "A conceptual tour de force, applying a vivid sense of procedural detail to a fiendishly intricate yarn set in the labyrinth of the unconscious mind, the writer-director has devised a heist thriller for surrealists, that challenges viewers to sift through multiple layers of (un)reality.",

    review:
      "It's a rolling explosion of images as hypnotizing and sharply angled as any in a drawing by M. C. Escher or a state-of-the-biz video game; the backwards splicing of Nolan's own Memento looks rudimentary by comparison.",

    review:
      "It's as if someone went into their heads while they were sleeping and planted the idea that Inception is a visionary masterpiece and—hold on ... Whoa! I think I get it. The movie is a metaphor for the power of delusional hype—a metaphor for itself.",

      "The best of traditional and modern filmmaking. If you're searching for smart and nervy popular entertainment, this is what it looks like.",
